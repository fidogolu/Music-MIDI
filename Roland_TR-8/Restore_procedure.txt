Follow the instructions from Roland up to the point where you disconnect the
Tr-8 physically from your computer (i.e. pull the USB cable). Do NOT switch
off the Tr-8 while the pads blink in rainbow colors. Try to count to 20, get you
a fresh cup of coffee or count the number of different colors that are
displayed on the pads. At some point the rainbow pattern switches to all pads
blinking in one single color: GREEN.

Now you can switch off the Tr-8 and the restore is successfully.
